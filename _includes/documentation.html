                    Chronix natively speaks <b>time series</b>. You can store nearly every kind of
                    data type within a time series due to its flexible design. You decide what a time series looks like.

                    <br><br>

                    Chronix is built to store time series highly compressed and for fast access times.
                    In comparison to related time series databases, Chronix does not only take 5 to 171 times less space,
                    but it also shaves off 83&#37; of the access time, and up to 78&#37;
                    off the runtime on a mix of real world queries.
                    For the measurements we used a commodity hardware laptop computer and Chronix using the Apache Solr
                    scenario (single node).

                    <br><br>

                    Chronix supports three different scenarios, pursuing different goals:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChronixDB/chronix.storage/">Chronix Storage:</a> Use Chronix as a small storage library and plug it into your
                        application. It stores the time series using <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/">Apache Lucene</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChronixDB/chronix.server/">Chronix Server:</a> Combine Chronix with <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> for a typical client-server scenario.
                        Apache Solr offers several useful features like scalability, fault tolerance, distributed indexing, or replication.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/ChronixDB/chronix.spark/">Chronix Spark:</a> Whenever you need a parallel and distributed time series processing,
                    integrate Chronix with <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>. Leverage Apache Spark to process a time series in parallel.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We have several presentations and papers that describe the architecture and the main concepts of
                    Chronix.
                    You will find the slides from the <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/apache_solr_as_a_compressed,_scalable_and_high_performance_time_series_database/">FOSDEM 2015</a> conference below. For more information about Chronix
                    and the current
                    development
